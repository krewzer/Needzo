# Helping-Hand
### Inspiration

After hearing the fearful stories on the news of  senior citizens flagging down strangers in grocery store parking lots to shop for them and seeing posts online of people who wanted to help but didn’t know how, we decided to build a service to match these two parties together.

Living in a neighbourhood with a high population of elderly, I see and can feel the need for a handy and user-friendly mobile platform for people to request help or lend a hand to their fellow neighbors, friends and citizens. There are a lot of us healthier individuals who are less at risk, who can do this for them and deliver to them in a safe manner in this COVID-19 situation.

The goal is to allow vulnerable populations who don’t have strong support systems to stay at home and reduce their risk of infection, while ensuring they can still get access to essentials like food and medicine.

### Solution
Our Solution lets those under self-isolation in a region post requests for deliveries and allows us to connect those who want to volunteer to help, purchase and deliver groceries for someone in need. A user can register as a delivery person or a receiver and see a list of corresponding people who they can help or be helped by.
